    <em>More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following situations:</em>
    <br /><br />
    <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.

    <strong> Other Users: </strong> When you share personal information (for example, by posting comments, contributions or other content to the Website) or otherwise interact with public areas of the Website, such personal information may be viewed by all users and may be publicly made available outside the Website in perpetuity. If you interact with other users of our Website and register for our Website through a social network (such as Facebook), your contacts on the social network will see your name, MyAccount photo, and descriptions of your activity. Similarly, other users will be able to view descriptions of your activity, communicate with you within our Website, and view your MyAccount.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong> 4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS? </strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <em>In Short:</em>  If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
    <br /><br /><br />
    Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain MyAccount information about you from your social media provider. The MyAccount information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, MyAccount picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.
    <br /><br /><br />
    We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>5. WHAT IS OUR STANCE ON THIRD-PARTY WEBSITES?</strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <em>In Short: </em>
    We are not responsible for the safety of any information that you share with third-party providers who advertise, but are not affiliated with, our Website.
    <br /><br /><br />
    The Website may contain advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites, online services or mobile applications. We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services or applications that may be linked to or from the Website. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact them directly to respond to your questions.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong> 6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION? </strong>
    <em> In short: </em>
    We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
    <br /><br /><br />
    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
    <br /><br /><br />
    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFOMATION SAFE? </strong>
    <em> In Short:</em>  We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
    <br /><br /><br />
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong> 8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS? </strong>
    <em>In Short:</em>  In some regions, such as the European Economic Area, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
    <br /><br /><br />
    In some regions (like the European Economic Area), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. To make such a request, please use the contact details provided below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.
    <br /><br /><br />
    If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.
    <br /><br /><br />
    If you are a resident in the European Economic Area and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority. You can find their contact details here: http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
    <br /><br /><br />
    If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the data protection authorities are available here: https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.
    <br /><br /><br />
    If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at VPbettingofficial@gmail.com.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>Account Information</strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:
    <br /><br /><br />
    Log in to your account settings and update your user account.
    <br /><br />
    Contact us using the contact information provided.
    <br /><br /><br />
    Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our Terms of Use and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>Opting out of email marketing:</strong> You can unsubscribe from our marketing email list at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send or by contacting us using the details provided below. You will then be removed from the marketing email list — however, we may still communicate with you, for example to send you service-related emails that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes. To otherwise opt-out, you may:
    <br />
    Access your account settings and update your preferences.
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong> 9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURED </strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("<strong>DNT</strong>") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. 
    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>10. DO CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    <em> In Short: </em>Yes, if you are a resident of California, you are granted specific rights regarding access to your personal information.
    <br /><br /><br />
    California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "<strong>Shine The Light</strong>" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.
    <br /><br /><br />
    If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Website, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Website. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Website, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).

    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.
    <br /><br /><br />
    We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "<strong>selling</strong>" of your personal data.
    <br /><br /><br />
    VP Betting has not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months. VP Betting will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users and other consumers.
    <br /><br /><br />

    <br /><br /><br />

    You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

    *The categories of personal information that we collect;

    In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

    <br /><br /><br />
    <strong>Verification process
    </strong>
    <br /><br /><br />
    Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
    <br /><br /><br />
    We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.
    <br /><br /><br />
    Other privacy rights
    <br /><br />
    you may object to the processing of your personal data
    <br /><br />
    you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data
    <br /><br />
    you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.
    <br /><br />
    you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.
    <br /><br />
    To exercise these rights, you can contact us by email at VPbettingofficial@gmail.com, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.
